**Hello,**

I myself was always looking for a good working script for a CarWhitelist so i can chose what job can drive a emergency vehicle, but never really could find something good, and something that actually did it right. So I made my own version of a CarWhitelist script.

# CarWhitelist-FiveM
A script that allows you to create vehicles for only one or several jobs, so you can make sure people dont steal emergency vehicles. Like police, ambulance and so on. This script causes no performance loss.

### Features:

- configureate what job can sit in a emergency as driver
- Notifications when kicked out of an emergency vehicle
- No performance loss, (0.01ms)
- Easy configureate what vehicles are whitelisted for emergency like police ambulance and so forth

_This script has a version check, new versions will be released regularly, so you can see it right at the start of the server._
