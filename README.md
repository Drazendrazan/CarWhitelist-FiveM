I myself have always been looking for a good working script for a Car Whitelist system, so that I can choose which job can drive a vehicle so for example someone who is not a police cannot drive a police car and so on. 

But I could never really find anything good, and something that actually did it well so that's why I made this **CarWhitelist** Script.

# CarWhitelist-FiveM

A script that allows you to make vehicles accessible only to a specific jobs, so you can make sure people don't steal emergency vehicles.

### Features:

> - Easy Configure which jobs can drive in emergency vehicles via the simple config.
> - You will be ejected from the vehicle if you do not have the job that is allowed in the vehicle.
> - Easy Configure what vehicles are only for emergency services like police, ambulance .
> - The Script does not cause lag or reduce server performance

### Requirements:

> - ESX (No matter which version just change config.lua)
