**Hello,**

I myself was always looking for a good working script for a CarWhitelist so i can chose what job can drive a emergency vehicle, but never really could find something good, and something that actually did it right. So I made a CarWhitelist script.

# CarWhitelist-FiveM
A script that allows you to create vehicles for only one or several jobs, so you can make sure people dont steal emergency vehicles. Like police, ambulance and so on.

### Features:

- configureate what job can sit in a emergency as driver
- Notifications when kicked out of an emergency vehicle
- No performance loss
- Easy configureate what vehicles are whitelisted for emergency like police ambulance and so forth

_This script has a version check, new versions will be released regularly, so you can see it right at the start of the server._

### Requirements:
- ESX
  
# Download and preview

### How to install
1. Download the recource
2. Change the config.lua to what you like

5. Enjoy the script :D
